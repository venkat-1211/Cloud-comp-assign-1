## Creating an EC2 Instance using terraform

        Step 1: Configure the aws and terraform by copying the credentials from the aws lab and paste it in _~/.aws/credentials_.

        Step 2: Make sure everything is set-up and configured fine by running the command "aws s3 ls". It will display the list of s3 buckets available and should return                 nothing if no buckets are created.
